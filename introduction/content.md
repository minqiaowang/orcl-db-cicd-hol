# Continuous Integration / Delivery / Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline with Oracle Database and Python

## Workshop Overview

**Continuous Integration (CI)** refers to the practice of frequently merging new software using a single line of code we call master branch. **Continuous Delivery (CD)** refers to the release of packaged software, modules, or features in frequent cycles. Likewise, **Continuous Deployment (CD)** refers to the deployment these software packages/modules/features to a production platform in frequent cycles.

>**Note** : Even though there are two CDs in the title (CI/CD/CD), only one is used in the acronym (CI/CD).
